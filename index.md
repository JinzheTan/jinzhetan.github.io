## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence and Law at the Faculty of Law, University of Montreal, supervised by [Prof. Karim Benyekhlef](https://www.karimbenyekhlef.ca/) and also a member of [Cyberjustice Laboratory](https://www.cyberjustice.ca/). My research focuses on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Law, aiming to enhance the accessibility and equality of the justice system. My current work applies AI to the legal domain across three main themes: <strong>(1)</strong> using AI to provide legal information, <strong>(2)</strong> supporting dispute resolution through intelligent systems, and <strong>(3)</strong> identifying, verifying, and mitigating flaws in judicial decision-making.

I have published and presented my research at several international conferences, and my contributions have been recognized by the ICAIL 2023 workshops, and International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX) 2023 & 2024, where my co-authored paper won the <strong>Best Paper Award</strong>. I'm always open to new collaborations‚Äîfeel free to get in touch if you'd like to connect!
