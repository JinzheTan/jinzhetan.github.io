## <span id="about">About Me</span>

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the Faculty of Law, University of Montreal, exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Law. As a member of the [Cyberjustice Laboratory](https://www.cyberjustice.ca/) and under the supervision of [Prof. Karim Benyekhlef](https://www.karimbenyekhlef.ca/), my research focuses on leveraging AI to improve the accessibility, fairness, and efficiency of the justice system.

My work applies AI to the legal domain across three core themes: **(1) AI-powered Legal Information Systems**, **(2) Intelligent Dispute Resolution Support**, and **(3) AI-driven Identifying, Verifying, and Mitigating Flaws in Judicial Decision-Making.**

I have published and presented my research at several international conferences. Notably, my co-authored paper received the **[Best Paper Award](https://jurix23.maastrichtlawtech.eu/proceedings/)** at the International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX) 2023, with further recognition at the [ICAIL 2023](https://icail2023.di.uminho.pt/) workshops and [JURIX 2024](https://jurix2024.law.muni.cz/).

I am always open to new collaborations‚Äîfeel free to get in touch if you'd like to connect!
