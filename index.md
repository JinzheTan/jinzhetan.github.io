## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence and Law at the Faculty of Law, University of Montreal. My research focuses on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Law, aiming to enhance the accessibility and equality of the justice system. My recent works range from developing legal expert systems with Large Language Models, using language models will help laypeople understand the law. 

I have published and presented my research at several international conferences, and my contributions have been recognized by the ICAIL 2023 workshops, and International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX) 2023, where my co-authored paper won the <strong>Best Paper Award<strong>.
